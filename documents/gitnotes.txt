To create a local remote repo:

2. Goto C:\Users\jxu\project\zenhubparent, run "git remote add origin C:\Users\jxu\git\zenweb.git"
3. In the same folder, run "git push origin master"

2. git checkout develop (switch to develop branch)
3. git push --set-upstream origin develop (push the branch to central bare repo)
4. To check branches: git branch
5. To delete branch: git branch -d develop 
6. To merge a branch: git merge feature_doc (switch to the destination branch first)
7. To hard delete a branch in bare repo: git branch -D feature_doc
